when comparing the sequences:
q1 = ACGAGT
db1 = ACGTACGT
q2 = ACGTACGT
db2 = ACGTACGT
q3 = ACTACGT
db3 = ACGTACGT
only the last case gets a false result, indicating a problem with up/left logic
second is fine -> diag likely correct -> fill likely correct
first is fine -> gaps in query handled correctly -> left correct?
third flase -> wtf???
